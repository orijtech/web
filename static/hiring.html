<center><h1>Who we look for</h1></center>
<p>Here at comma, we don't care about the source of your education or your traditional puffed up resume, we care about your <b>abilities</b>. We are looking for the following traits:<p>
<hr>

<h2>Competitors</h2>
People who have done well at math competitions(USAMO, IMO, PUTNAM), competition programming(ACM, USACO, codejam, topcoder), science fairs(ISEF, STS), or capture the flag(DEFCON, secuinside, GITS). Those competitions don't just select for ability, they also select for quickness. We are in a very competitive space.

<h2>Contributors</h2>
People who have contributed value to open source projects. Show me your github. Got stars? Code is never measured in quantity, but rather quality. We value those who can do more with less code; software engineering doesn't have an external selection pressure for low part count and cost like EE and ME, but you pay massive costs down the line in debugging and upkeep.

<h2>Architects</h2>
People who can design good APIs and source layouts on the first try. This is crucial to working in teams and scaling. Before you do work, you should be able to explain to a contractor what you want done. ME has a great divide between design and machining that software lacks; we want to try to fix that.

<h2>Rigor</h2>
It's easy to build something that works. It's hard to build something that works 100% of the time. At comma, crashes are real.

<br/><br/><hr><br/>
We are looking to assemble a small elite team. We want people who value being right, but not at the expense of being wrong. Roles we are hiring for listed <a href="positions.html">here</a>.
