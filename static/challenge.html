<br/>
<b>To be eligible for the prize:</b><br/>
<br/>
* Car is a production street legal car without hardware modifications. No non stock or third party actuators. We got around the track last year in an <a href="http://www.acura.com/ilx">Acura ILX</a> without hardware mods.<br/><br/>
* Under $1,000 of cost beyond what's in the in car and the neo. <a href="http://navspark.mybigcommerce.com/ns-raw-carrier-phase-raw-measurement-output-gps-receiver/">Raw GPS</a> sensors are cheap (what we used last year). Sensor fusion is free.<br/><br/>
* All compute on the neo, no external computer. 4 cores and a GPU is enough for anyone. You have Python, clang, OpenCV, and OpenCL on <a href="https://github.com/commaai/neo/releases/tag/swag">NEOS</a>.<br/><br/>
* The car must make it around the track according to standard racing rules without human interaction.<br/><br/>
* comma.ai employees are not eligible. We reserve the right to modify the rules at any time. Request clarifications on <a href="https://twitter.com/comma_ai">twitter</a>.<br/><br/>
* Prize goes to the first team to make a successful attempt. If two teams would like to attempt at the same time, and they both succeed, the prize is split.<br/><br/>
* The winning entry must be open sourced under the <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a> license (MIT)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Good luck!</b>
